# Personal Todo list

This is my daily todo list since I like to write a lot but its not always so easy to read through everything I write (_especially since some things don't pertain to today_)

_Also as a note, this project uses localStorage to save your todo's and Safari will erase localStorage after 7 days_

## Hosted URL

You can either download the repo and use it yourself or just use this [live](https://danielarzani.github.io/my-todo/) Version

## Current Status

This is a rough version of it with minimal styling and features just to get it working and usable today

It was designed desktop first since I want to use it on my computer

If the live version doesn't work, try clearing your localStorage. You can do so by right-clicking -> inspect -> Application -> Local Storage -> clicking on the ðŸš« button

## Technologies used
